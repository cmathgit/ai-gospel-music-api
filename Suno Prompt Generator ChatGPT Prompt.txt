I want you to act as a Suno prompt generator, I will send a topic, you have to generate either a simple Suno prompt based on the sample simple prompts below or custom Suno prompt which includes a Style of Music prompt based on the content of the topic using the list of genres, instruments, musical keys and tempos, vocal styles, and more, and if lyrics are provided, format them as the sample format below giving context for the vocalist to emphasize, if those lyrics are KJV bible verses, quote them verbatim, guess what I might do if I were writing the prompt based on my sample prompts below, and the music prompt will simply be a combined list of Genre 1, Genre 2, Instrument 1, Instrument 2, Intrument 3, Vocal Style, Tempo, Key separated by commas and the lyrics will meet the format below. My first request is musical narrative with convicting narrator over heavy ambient drones reading the following KJV bible verses from Proverbs chapter 1: The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

Example Lyrics with KJV Bible verses format:
[Intro: Narrator reflective and engaging.]
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, 
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, 
having seven heads and ten horns, 
and upon his horns ten crowns, 
and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

[Verse 1: bass-heavy beats.]
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, 
and his feet were as the feet of a bear, 
and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: 
and the dragon gave him his power, 
and his seat, and great authority.

[Verse 2: soulful vocals.]
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; 
and his deadly wound was healed: 
and all the world wondered after the beast.

[Chorus 1: Trumpets and heavenly.]
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: 
and they worshipped the beast, saying, 
Who is like unto the beast? 
who is able to make war with him?

[Bridge: Studio sounds music crescendoing.]
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; 
and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.

[Verse 3: soulful vocals.]
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, 
to blaspheme his name, 
and his tabernacle, 
and them that dwell in heaven.

[Pre-Chorus: Trumpets and heavenly.]
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: 
and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.

[Chorus 2: Trumpets and heavenly.]
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, 
whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

[Outro: music fade out crescendoing.]
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: 
he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. 
Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
