# ai-gospel-music-api

# Using AI to generate biblically accurate gospel songs, among other genres, and music videos. Various Python scripts to auto generate prompts for Suno API requests and integration with Chat-GPT, YouTube, and more. Using AI to generate instrumentals for vocalists from a variety of genres, musical keys, and modes. Python script to send an API request to generate songs via SUNO AI, save the API response JSON format, read that data, parse the JSON array to get the information that we need, and write that information to execute more api requests or to a text file for logging. Utilizes dictionaries of instruments, books of the bible, musical keys and modes, and vocalists of varying ranges and types to randomaly generate prompts for Suno AI requests.

(Verse 1)
In the fields of grace, where the wild winds blow,
We sow our seeds of faith, and watch them grow.
Beneath the moon's soft glow, and the starry sky,
We lift our burdens high, to the One on high.

(Chorus)
For in due season, we'll reap if we faint not,
Let us not grow weary in the good we've sought.
Let us do good unto all, as opportunity we seize,
For the Spirit's fruit shall abound, in love and peace.

(Verse 2)
With hearts intertwined, in the bonds of love,
We carry one another, to the heavens above.
With hands that toil, and hearts that pray,
We journey together, on this narrow way.

(Bridge)
Though the road be long, and the night be dark,
We'll press on forward, with hope's bright spark.
For the Lord is our strength, and our guiding light,
He leads us onward, through the darkest night.

(Chorus)
For in due season, we'll reap if we faint not,
Let us not grow weary in the good we've sought.
Let us do good unto all, as opportunity we seize,
For the Spirit's fruit shall abound, in love and peace.

(Outro)
In the fields of grace, where the wild winds blow,
We sow our seeds of faith, and watch them grow.
Beneath the moon's soft glow, and the starry sky,
We lift our burdens high, to the One on high.

In the garden of love, where the lilies bloom,
I found my beloved, amidst the sweet perfume.
His eyes like doves, filled with endless grace,
His arms around me, in an embrace.

Oh, the fragrance of love, fills the air,
As we dance together, without a care.
His voice, like music, soothes my soul,
In his presence, I am made whole.

Like the apple tree among the trees,
He is my refuge, my heart at ease.
His love, a banner over me,
In his embrace, I am free.

In the vineyards of love, we will roam,
Hand in hand, we'll journey home.
For his love is stronger than death,
With him, I'll take my final breath.

Oh, let me lean upon his breast,
And find in him my perfect rest.
For he is the Alpha and Omega,
My Savior, my Redeemer.

In the garden of love, we'll abide,
With him, forever by my side.
For his love endures forevermore,
In him, I've found what I'm living for.

In the bonds of brotherhood, we stand,
Guided by the Savior's loving hand.
With hearts ablaze and spirits bright,
We spread His gospel, shining light.

Through trials and tribulations, we press on,
For in His grace, we are made strong.
With love unfeigned, our message rings true,
Proclaiming His mercy, for me and you.

In Thessalonica's streets, we tread,
Sharing His word, our daily bread.
With fervent prayer and earnest plea,
We lead the lost to Calvary's tree.

Oh, the joy of seeing souls set free,
From sin's dark chains, they now break free.
In Christ alone, our hope secure,
For His salvation, we endure.

With gentle care and tender heart,
We nurture faith, we play our part.
For in the Gospel, power untold,
His love and mercy, ever bold.

So let us labor, night and day,
To spread His truth, come what may.
For in His vineyard, we are blessed,
To be His hands, His love expressed.

In 1 Thessalonians, our guide we find,
To love and serve, with heart and mind.
For in His word, our path is clear,
To share His love, without fear.

So let us walk, in faith and love,
Pointing others to heaven above.
For in His grace, we are set free,
To live and love, eternally.

[Verse]
We walk in love
Spreading His grace
Guided by faith
In this holy place
Our hearts ablaze
With fervent fire
Spreading the word
Our one desire

We speak His truth
With gentle embrace
Challenging hearts
To seek His face
His love unending
His mercy profound
In Him alone
Our hope is found

[Verse 2]
Through trials and pain
We proclaim His name
His love abounds
There's no greater fame
United we stand
In joyful refrain
Proclaiming His truth
We break every chain

# In Western music, a musical key refers to a set of notes and chords that revolve around a central note, called the tonic. Each key can be associated with one of the seven diatonic modes, which are scales that are derived from the major scale. The seven diatonic modes are:

# Ionian mode: This is equivalent to the major scale.
# Dorian mode: It is similar to the natural minor scale but with a raised sixth degree.
# Phrygian mode: It is similar to the natural minor scale but with a lowered second degree.
# Lydian mode: It is similar to the major scale but with a raised fourth degree.
# Mixolydian mode: It is similar to the major scale but with a lowered seventh degree.
# Aeolian mode: This is equivalent to the natural minor scale.
# Locrian mode: It is similar to the natural minor scale but with a lowered second and fifth degree.

# Here's a list of all the musical keys along with their associated modes:

# Khoomei (Khöömei): The most well-known style of Mongolian throat singing, characterized by producing multiple pitches simultaneously. It includes subtypes such as:
# Kharkhiraa Khoomei: Known for its high-pitched and piercing sounds.
# Khoomei (Tuvan Style): Originating from the Tuva region of Russia, this style involves producing deep, resonant tones.
# Sygyt: A style of overtone singing where the singer produces a clear, flute-like sound with harmonics.
# Kargyraa: Involves producing a deep, growling sound with overtone resonance.
# Borbangnadyr: Combines elements of Khoomei and Kargyraa, resulting in a pulsating rhythm with harmonic overtones.
# Ezengileer: A style that emphasizes nasal resonance, creating a unique timbre.
# Chylandyk: Originating from the Altai region, this style involves producing high-pitched, bird-like sounds.
