# Don't want to run Python scripts? Try this prompt in ChatGPT o1 or Gemini 1.5 Flash
# We tested this use case in ChatGPT, Gemini 1.5 flash, and Perplexity Pro, and each LLM gave me exactly what I wanted. I wrote all this python code to parse text and JSON arrays to formulate random prompts. We haven't tested with more use cases, so the question to ask is "will the LLM use the same genre and music key tempo every time"? All three LLMs used F# Locrian as the musical key which is not specific to my instructions. Yes, there are examples with that key, but there are other keys also. My python code does handle the random combinations, so it may not be totally useless. :)

I want you to act as a Suno prompt generator, I will send a topic, you have to generate either a simple Suno prompt based on the sample simple prompts below or custom Suno prompt which includes a Style of Music prompt based on the content of the topic using the list of genres, instruments, musical keys and tempos, vocal styles, and more, and if lyrics are provided, format them as the sample format below giving context for the vocalist to emphasize, if those lyrics are KJV bible verses, quote them verbatim, guess what I might do if I were writing the prompt based on my sample prompts below, and the music prompt will simply be a combined list of Genre 1, Genre 2, Instrument 1, Instrument 2, Intrument 3, Vocal Style, Tempo, Key separated by commas and the lyrics will meet the format below. My first request is musical narrative with convicting narrator over heavy ambient drones reading the following KJV bible verses from Proverbs chapter 1: The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

# Setup and Installation (Using Virtual Environment)

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects or system-wide packages.

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd ai-gospel-music-auto-suno
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory (`ai-gospel-music-auto-suno`), and run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
    This command creates a directory named `env` (you can choose a different name) containing a private Python installation.

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```batch
        .\env\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
        (If you encounter script execution errors, you might need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`)
    *   **On Linux/macOS (Bash/Zsh):**
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
    Once activated, your command prompt should show the environment name (e.g., `(env)`).

3.  **Install required packages:**
    With the virtual environment active, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Deactivate the virtual environment (when done):**
    Simply run:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

# Running the Scripts

*   **Basic Prompt Generation:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the project root directory with the virtual environment active
    python generate_biblical_lyrics_simple_prompts.py
    ```
*   **Batch Prompt Generation (Windows):**
    ```batch
    # Runs generate_prompts_suno_ai.py 100 times
    runpy_gen_prompts_suno.bat
    ```
*   **Example Usage: Generating Combined Bible Prompts (`generate_prompts_bible.py`)**

    This script provides a practical example of how to combine the functionalities from different generation modules within the project. It demonstrates generating both music style prompts and Bible-based lyrics using the AI refinement features.

    Specifically, `generate_prompts_bible.py` does the following:
    1.  **Imports:** It imports the necessary generation functions from `gen_custom_rand_style_of_music.py` and `gen_custom_lyrics_kjv_verbatim_votd.py`.
    2.  **Loads Environment:** It uses `python-dotenv` to load variables from your `.env` file. This is crucial as the imported functions rely on the API keys and Control Flow contexts defined there.
    3.  **Generates Styles:** It calls functions from `gen_custom_rand_style_of_music.py` to create and print both the original randomly combined and the AI-revised prompts for various music styles: general (with vocals), drum loops, and concertos. It also shows the generated "exclude styles" strings.
    4.  **Generates Lyrics:**
        *   It calls `generate_bible_gateway_votd_verbatim_custom` to fetch the KJV Verse of the Day and then uses Control Flow to structure it into lyrics.
        *   It calls `get_random_bible_passage` to retrieve the text from a random KJV chapter, prints source information, generates a full citation using `get_citation_bible_book_and_chapter`, and then employs `revise_prompt_with_control_flow_kjv_verbatim` to structure the chapter text into lyrics using AI.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Basic `try...except` blocks are included to gracefully handle potential errors during generation (e.g., API connectivity issues, missing dataset files) and provide informative messages.
    6.  **Main Guard:** It uses `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensuring the generation process runs only when the script is executed directly.
    7.  **Prerequisite Check:** Before running the main logic, it performs a basic check for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable and warns the user if it's missing, as it's essential for the AI-powered features.

    **To Run the Example:**
    Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with the necessary API keys and Control Flow contexts, and that the required JSON files exist within the `datasets/` directory (including the `Bible-kjv` data). Then, activate your virtual environment and run:
    ```bash
    python generate_prompts_bible.py
    ```
    This will execute the script and print examples of all the generated outputs to your console.

*   **Example Usage: Generating Combined Mnemonic Prompts (`generate_prompts_mnemonic.py`)**

    This script demonstrates combining mnemonic topic lyric generation with random music style generation.

    This script follows the same pattern as `generate_prompts_bible.py`:
    1.  **Imports:** It imports functions from `gen_custom_lyrics_mnemonic.py` and `gen_custom_rand_style_of_music.py`.
    2.  **Loads Environment:** Loads variables from `.env`.
    3.  **Generates Styles:** Calls the style generation functions (general, drums, concerto) and prints results.
    4.  **Generates Mnemonic Lyrics:**
        *   Calls `generate_mnemonic_topic_prompt` which handles selecting a random topic, generating a summary via the LLM, and then structuring that summary into lyrics using Control Flow.
        *   Takes a pre-defined example text (about Relativity) and passes it directly to `revise_prompt_with_control_flow_mnemonic` to structure it into lyrics.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Includes `try...except` blocks.
    6.  **Main Guard:** Uses `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
    7.  **Prerequisite Checks:** Adds warnings if the necessary API key or Control Flow contexts are missing from the environment.

    **To Run the Example:**
    Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with the necessary API keys and Control Flow contexts, and that the required JSON files exist within the `datasets/` directory (like `random_mnemonic_topics_dict.json`). Then, activate your virtual environment and run:
    ```bash
    python generate_prompts_mnemonic.py
    ```
    This will execute the script and print examples of the generated styles and mnemonic lyrics to your console.

# Using AI-Powered Prompt Refinement (Control Flow & Gemini)

Some scripts in this project leverage AI models like Google Gemini via the `controlflow` and `langchain-google-genai` libraries to intelligently refine generated prompts or structure content.

*   **Purpose:** These scripts take raw input (like Bible verses, random topics, or combined musical elements) and use an AI model, acting under specific instructions defined by a `CONTROL_FLOW_CONTEXT`, to format the text into more suitable prompts or structured content (like song lyrics) for downstream use (e.g., with the Suno AI).
*   **Configuration:**
    *   These scripts require specific environment variables to be set. Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory if it doesn't already exist.
    *   Add the necessary variables to your `.env` file. The example below is for using Google Generative AI:
        ```env
        # Example for Google Generative AI:
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
        MODEL_NAME="gemini-1.5-flash" # Or another compatible Google model
        CONTROL_FLOW_CONTEXT_KJV="your_kjv_verbatim_context_identifier" # Context for KJV verbatim lyrics
        CONTROL_FLOW_CONTEXT_LYRICIST="your_mnemonic_lyricist_context_identifier" # Context for mnemonic lyric generation
        CONTROL_FLOW_CONTEXT_STYLES="your_style_refinement_context_identifier" # Context for music style refinement

        # Add other contexts as needed by different scripts
        ```
    *   **Important:** The required environment variable for the API key **depends on the LLM provider you choose**. For example:
        *   Google uses `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
        *   OpenAI uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
        *   Anthropic uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
    *   **Always consult the documentation for the specific model provider and LangChain integration you are using** to find the correct environment variable names and any other required configuration settings.
        *   **ControlFlow LLM Configuration Guide:** [https://controlflow.ai/guides/configure-llms](https://controlflow.ai/guides/configure-llms)
        *   **LangChain Chat Model Integrations:** [https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)
    *   The script uses `python-dotenv` to automatically load these variables from the `.env` file when executed.
    *   **Default Model Interface:** The scripts currently default to using `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` from the `langchain-google-genai` library as the interface to the specified `MODEL_NAME`. The model configuration (like `temperature`) can be adjusted directly in the script (e.g., `gen_custom_lyrics_kjv_verbatim_votd.py`).
    *   **Changing the Model/Provider:** While the current setup uses Google Generative AI via LangChain, the `controlflow` library is designed to work with various models and providers supported by LangChain. You can adapt the scripts to use different models or APIs by:
        1.  Installing the necessary provider package (e.g., `pip install langchain-openai`).
        2.  Setting the correct API key environment variable (see links above).
        3.  Modifying the model initialization part in the Python script (e.g., changing `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` to `ChatOpenAI` or `ChatAnthropic` and updating parameters). Refer to the ControlFlow and LangChain documentation for details.
*   **Potential Issues:**
    *   **HTTP 400 Errors:** Occasionally, when using Control Flow with certain models like Gemini, an intermediate step might result in an empty string being passed as input to the model API. This can cause an `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error from the API provider. If you encounter this, check the logs or debug the Control Flow execution to see if an empty prompt is being generated. You might need to add checks in the script to ensure prompts are not empty before calling `cf.run` or adjust the Control Flow context/instructions to prevent empty outputs.

## AI-Powered Script Details

### KJV Verbatim & VotD Lyrics (`gen_custom_lyrics_kjv_verbatim_votd.py`)

*   **Functionality:** This script focuses on generating lyrics directly from King James Version Bible text.
    *   It can fetch the KJV Verse of the Day (VotD) using the `biblegateway_api`.
    *   Alternatively, it can select a random chapter from a random book using the `datasets/Bible-kjv` data.
    *   The selected Bible text is then passed to the `revise_prompt_with_control_flow_kjv_verbatim` function.
    *   This function uses the AI model (via Control Flow, configured by `CONTROL_FLOW_CONTEXT_KJV`) to arrange the verbatim verses into a conventional song structure (e.g., [Intro], [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Verse 2], etc.) while preserving the original text and verse order. It handles potential length constraints by trimming input if necessary.
*   **Usage:** These scripts primarily provide functions to be imported and used by other parts of your workflow or potentially by higher-level orchestration scripts. The refined prompts generated by these functions can then be used for Suno API requests.
    ```python
    # Example usage from within another script:
    from gen_custom_lyrics_kjv_verbatim_votd import revise_prompt_with_control_flow_kjv_verbatim

    bible_verses = "Your input bible verses here..."
    refined_lyrics_prompt = revise_prompt_with_control_flow_kjv_verbatim(bible_verses)
    print(refined_lyrics_prompt)

    # Or using the Verse of the Day function:
    from gen_custom_lyrics_kjv_verbatim_votd import generate_bible_gateway_votd_verbatim_custom

    votd_revised_lyrics_prompt, biblecontent, biblereference, bibleversion, verselink = generate_bible_gateway_votd_verbatim_custom()
    print(votd_revised_lyrics_prompt)
    ```

# Using the Bible Gateway API

Bible Gateway can be implemented to pull the verse of the day for generating lyrics instead of using the bible book dictionary. For the King James Version, use this url

# Sample code to call the Biblegateway API URI for the Verse of the Day (see `biblegateway_api.py`)
```python
    # Use Bible Gateway Verse of the Day
    from biblegateway_api import get_bible_votd_kjv

    votds = get_bible_votd_kjv()
    print("Bible Verse Content: ", votds['votd']['content'])
    print("Bible Verse reference: ", votds['votd']['reference'])
    print("Bible Verse version: ", votds['votd']['version']) # Corrected key
    biblecontent = votds['votd']['content']
    biblereference = votds['votd']['reference']
    bibleversion = votds['votd']['version'] # Corrected key
```

# Bible Gateway can be implemented to pull the verse of the day for generating lyrics instead of using the bible book dictionary. For the King James Version, use this url
```
https://www.biblegateway.com/votd/get/?format=JSON&version=9
```
# Sample code to call the Biblegateway API URI for the Verse of the Day
```
    #Use Bible Gateway Verse of the Day
    votds = get_bible_votd_kjv()
    print("Bible Verse Content: ", votds['votd']['content'])
    print("Bible Verse reference: ", votds['votd']['reference'])
    print("Bible Verse reference: ", votds['votd']['version'])
    biblecontent = votds['votd']['content']
    biblereference = votds['votd']['reference']
    bibleversion = votds['votd']['version']
```

(Verse 1)
In the fields of grace, where the wild winds blow,
We sow our seeds of faith, and watch them grow.
Beneath the moon's soft glow, and the starry sky,
We lift our burdens high, to the One on high.

(Chorus)
For in due season, we'll reap if we faint not,
Let us not grow weary in the good we've sought.
Let us do good unto all, as opportunity we seize,
For the Spirit's fruit shall abound, in love and peace.

(Verse 2)
With hearts intertwined, in the bonds of love,
We carry one another, to the heavens above.
With hands that toil, and hearts that pray,
We journey together, on this narrow way.

(Bridge)
Though the road be long, and the night be dark,
We'll press on forward, with hope's bright spark.
For the Lord is our strength, and our guiding light,
He leads us onward, through the darkest night.

(Chorus)
For in due season, we'll reap if we faint not,
Let us not grow weary in the good we've sought.
Let us do good unto all, as opportunity we seize,
For the Spirit's fruit shall abound, in love and peace.

(Outro)
In the fields of grace, where the wild winds blow,
We sow our seeds of faith, and watch them grow.
Beneath the moon's soft glow, and the starry sky,
We lift our burdens high, to the One on high.

His mercy profound
In Him alone
Our hope is found

[Verse 2]
Through trials and pain
We proclaim His name
His love abounds
There's no greater fame
United we stand
In joyful refrain
Proclaiming His truth
We break every chain

# In Western music, a musical key refers to a set of notes and chords that revolve around a central note, called the tonic. Each key can be associated with one of the seven diatonic modes, which are scales that are derived from the major scale. The seven diatonic modes are:

# Ionian mode: This is equivalent to the major scale.
# Dorian mode: It is similar to the natural minor scale but with a raised sixth degree.
# Phrygian mode: It is similar to the natural minor scale but with a lowered second degree.
# Lydian mode: It is similar to the major scale but with a raised fourth degree.
# Mixolydian mode: It is similar to the major scale but with a lowered seventh degree.
# Aeolian mode: This is equivalent to the natural minor scale.
# Locrian mode: It is similar to the natural minor scale but with a lowered second and fifth degree.

# Here's a list of all the musical keys along with their associated modes:

# Khoomei (Khöömei): The most well-known style of Mongolian throat singing, characterized by producing multiple pitches simultaneously. It includes subtypes such as:
# Kharkhiraa Khoomei: Known for its high-pitched and piercing sounds.
# Khoomei (Tuvan Style): Originating from the Tuva region of Russia, this style involves producing deep, resonant tones.
# Sygyt: A style of overtone singing where the singer produces a clear, flute-like sound with harmonics.
# Kargyraa: Involves producing a deep, growling sound with overtone resonance.
# Borbangnadyr: Combines elements of Khoomei and Kargyraa, resulting in a pulsating rhythm with harmonic overtones.
# Ezengileer: A style that emphasizes nasal resonance, creating a unique timbre.
# Chylandyk: Originating from the Altai region, this style involves producing high-pitched, bird-like sounds.

# Running the Scripts

*   **Basic Prompt Generation:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the project root directory with the virtual environment active
    python generate_biblical_lyrics_simple_prompts.py
    ```
*   **Batch Prompt Generation (Windows):**
    ```batch
    # Runs generate_prompts_suno_ai.py 100 times
    runpy_gen_prompts_suno.bat
    ```
*   **Example Usage: Generating Combined Bible Prompts (`generate_prompts_bible.py`)**

    This script provides a practical example of how to combine the functionalities from different generation modules within the project. It demonstrates generating both music style prompts and Bible-based lyrics using the AI refinement features.

    Specifically, `generate_prompts_bible.py` does the following:
    1.  **Imports:** It imports the necessary generation functions from `gen_custom_rand_style_of_music.py` and `gen_custom_lyrics_kjv_verbatim_votd.py`.
    2.  **Loads Environment:** It uses `python-dotenv` to load variables from your `.env` file. This is crucial as the imported functions rely on the API keys and Control Flow contexts defined there.
    3.  **Generates Styles:** It calls functions from `gen_custom_rand_style_of_music.py` to create and print both the original randomly combined and the AI-revised prompts for various music styles: general (with vocals), drum loops, and concertos. It also shows the generated "exclude styles" strings.
    4.  **Generates Lyrics:**
        *   It calls `generate_bible_gateway_votd_verbatim_custom` to fetch the KJV Verse of the Day and then uses Control Flow to structure it into lyrics.
        *   It calls `get_random_bible_passage` to retrieve the text from a random KJV chapter, prints source information, generates a full citation using `get_citation_bible_book_and_chapter`, and then employs `revise_prompt_with_control_flow_kjv_verbatim` to structure the chapter text into lyrics using AI.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Basic `try...except` blocks are included to gracefully handle potential errors during generation (e.g., API connectivity issues, missing dataset files) and provide informative messages.
    6.  **Main Guard:** It uses `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensuring the generation process runs only when the script is executed directly.
    7.  **Prerequisite Check:** Before running the main logic, it performs a basic check for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable and warns the user if it's missing, as it's essential for the AI-powered features.

    **To Run the Example:**
    Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with the necessary API keys and Control Flow contexts, and that the required JSON files exist within the `datasets/` directory (including the `Bible-kjv` data). Then, activate your virtual environment and run:
    ```bash
    python generate_prompts_bible.py
    ```
    This will execute the script and print examples of all the generated outputs to your console.
