[Verse]
In the book of Titus
A message so divine
Spreading love and truth
The Gospel of Christ is thine
"Paul
A servant for God
An apostle by His will"
Teaching justice and peace
His purpose to fulfill

[Verse 2]
For the believers
A life transformed by grace
Living with integrity and love
In every place
To the pure
All things are pure
In their hearts so true
Following His teachings
In everything they do

[Chorus]
Oh
Let the words of Titus echo in our souls
Guiding us to righteousness
Making us whole
With passionate hearts
Let us spread His glorious name
Forever faithful
His message we proclaim
