In Him are hid all treasures bold
Of wisdom's light and knowledge told
Beware lest any spoil with lies
Through tradition dark in disguise

Rooted built up in Him we stand
Faith established by His hand
Abounding in our thanks and love
Christ is our fullness from above

[Verse 2]
Let no man judge you by old ways
In holy days or Sabbaths’ praise
Which are shadows of things to come
But the body is in God's Son

[Bridge]
Philosophy vain deceit
Cannot change what’s been complete
In Christ
All fullness does reside
We’re alive with Him inside

[Chorus]
Rooted built up in Him we stand
Faith established by His hand
Abounding in our thanks and love
Christ is our fullness from above

[Verse 3]
Let no one beguile your place
In voluntary humility's face
Holding fast to the Head divine
From which all body grows in line
