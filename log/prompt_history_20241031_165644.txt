Solo Concerto Orchestral Prestissimo 211 D# Phrygian 20241031_165639

Using AI to generate concertos in spite of Geoffrey Jefferson's reflections on artificial intelligence.

On June 9, at Manchester University’s Lister Oration, British brain surgeon Geoffrey Jefferson states, "Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain – that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or miserable when it cannot get what it wants."

Using AI to generate concertos in spite of Geoffrey Jefferson's reflections on artificial intelligence.

On June 9, at Manchester University’s Lister Oration, British brain surgeon Geoffrey Jefferson states, "Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain – that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or miserable when it cannot get what it wants."
