And if it seem evil unto you to serve the <span class="small-caps" >Lord</span>, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the <span class="small-caps" >Lord</span>.
