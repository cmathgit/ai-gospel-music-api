Then Peter said unto them, Repent, 
and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, 
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

[Verse 1: Shift to bass-heavy beats.]
Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, 
that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.

[Verse 2: Uplifting hymns and soulful vocals play.]
Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, 
that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;

[Verse 3: Shift to bass-heavy beats.]
He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, 
that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

[Verse 4: Uplifting hymns and soulful vocals play.]
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, 
and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, 
he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, 
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

[Verse 5: Studio sounds with [Fade out with music crescendoing.]
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, 
that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, 
and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

[Chorus: Trumpets and heavenly hosts sounds play.]
Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, 
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

Lyrics Prompt:
[Intro: Narrator reflective and engaging with Acoustic guitar and live audience sounds play.]
For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

[Verse 1: Shift to bass-heavy beats.]
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, 
according to the will of God and our Father:
To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

[Verse 2: Uplifting hymns and soulful vocals play.]
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
But though we, or an angel from heaven, 
preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
As we said before, so say I now again, 
if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

[Chorus: Trumpets and heavenly hosts sounds play.]
For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? 
for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

[Verse 3: Shift to bass-heavy beats.]
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

[Verse 4: Uplifting hymns and soulful vocals play.]
For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

[Verse 5: Studio sounds with [Fade out with music crescendoing.]
But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,
To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.
